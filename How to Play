/* Once the game runs you look at the two cards that were dealt to you and you decide if you want to hit (take another card) or stay 
   (not take another card) because the total value of the cards cannot be greater than 21. You repeat this process until you bust
   (where total card values go over 21) or until you decide to stay. After your turn is over the dealer deals himself some cards to
   try to be you. If the dealer gets 21 he wins and also if the dealer gets a closer number to 21 than you he wins). If both the dealer
   and the player have over 21 no one wins. To play again click the Yes button and to quit the game click the No button.
   
   P.S: An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 and all Face Cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10.
